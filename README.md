Redux Counter Example
=====================

This code implements a tally app using the Redux pattern

Features
========

- Implements a reducer function to handle state changes
- Creates a store using the reducer and initial state
- Subscribes to state changes with a logging function
- Dispatches actions to increment, decrement, and reset the counter

Learning Experience
==================

While working on this code, I learned how to use JSDoc comments to document my code and make it more readable and maintainable. I used typedefs to define the format of my state and actions, and I used JSDoc comments to explain the purpose of each function and variable. This taught me the importance of clear documentation and how it can help others and myself understand my code better.

Usage
=======
Run the code in a JavaScript environment to see the counter in action. The logging function will print the current state after each action.
